# AED_Projects
"Algoritmos e estruturas de dados" Project for Univerity of Coimbra.
Here are 3 projects:
The first is just to understand the big-O notation.
The second is the comparison of data structures: binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees and RB trees.
The third is the comparison of sort algorithms: insertion sort, heap sort and quick sort.

Note: all the code was my own development.
